## About Us

We are a mental health service specialising in neurodivergence. Our aim is to become the helping hand you needed.

Whether you are looking for support in formally identifying a neurodivergent condition, managing mental health difficulties, increasing your independence, meeting interpersonal goals, or navigating interactions with the Department of Work and Pensions — we are here to help.

We offer:

- Professional counselling
- Psychological coaching
- Neurodivergent screening
- Autism assessment

All of our staff and associated professionals identify as neurodivergent, and most were identified as neurodivergent adults. We combine professional training with genuine lived experience.
