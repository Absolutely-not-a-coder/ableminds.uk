Able Minds is a clinical group composed of neurodivergent specialists who focus on assessing and supporting neurodivergent individuals and families.

## How We Started

Our core staff developed Able Minds through sharing personal experiences during neurodivergent assessments. Despite collective experience across seven different Local Authority services, we felt inadequately supported during our own post-diagnosis adjustment periods.

That gap inspired us to create neurodiversity-informed support services — built by neurodivergent people, for neurodivergent people.

## Our Approach

Our clinical approach combines lived neurodivergent experience with formal training in Psychology, Counselling, Coaching, and Psychiatric Nursing. We understand what it's like to be neurodivergent, and we recognise both the personal and broader impacts of assessment and ongoing support.

We provide a wrap-around service offering post-diagnostic support tailored to individual needs, leveraging specialist lived experience and professional training.
